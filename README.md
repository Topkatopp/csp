# csp

information if you wanna run compile write in cmd: 'csp file'

recomendation set the csp folder to the %PATH%

csp is compiler which compile a python code to the C# code

the one of problem compiler is in not full working and a commands like a 'def' or others can be not work
and in command 'if ' i end of that command like a example:
if 'csp' == 'csp':
  print('csp')
  endif
  here you need add a 'endif' without that it don't work
  
the same think with command 'while' example:

while 'csp' == 'csp':
  print('csp')
  ndwhile
  here you need add a 'endwhile'

the avaible commands wich compiler can compile is:
if with 'add'
if with 'or'
print()
avaible (str) = input()
input()
while
avaibles variables: (float) (int) (str) it not fully work with print() (PS. i gonna fix it)
and work (True) the False not complet created
